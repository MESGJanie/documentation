# What is a Service?

A Service is a normalized bi-directional communication layer, which acts a connection from any technology to Core.   
  
Services allow information on any [Event](emit-an-event.md) to be transmitted to Core, and allow [Tasks](listen-for-tasks.md) to be triggered from Core.

**In Q3 2018**, once the Network is deployed, Services can be shared or sold on our Marketplace, allowing users to use any technology without needing to code. However, for the time being, developers will need to create their own Services or share them on GitHub. 

## Steps in a Service

A basic Service is built of two main steps: listening for events and execution of tasks.

1. [**Event**](emit-an-event.md)
2. [**Task**](listen-for-tasks.md)
