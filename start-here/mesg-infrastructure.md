# MESG Infrastructure

**Note: The MESG Infrastructure's full deployment is scheduled for Q3 2018. Until then, MESG can be used to connect technologies and build solutions **[**on your local computer**](installing-core.md)**. This article is to describe what is currently being built.**  
  
The MESG Infrastructure is made up of a decentralized Network of all users computers running Core.   
  
Like many decentralized networks, when a [Service](../service/what-is-a-service.md) is deployed, it will be shared among the nodes in the network. All of the nodes using the Service will re-seed this connection to share with others.   
  
MESG fairly and automatically rewards contributors who either help produce an initial connection, or help process a task. 

The creators of connections, workflows or applications choose their price, and dictate what each actor in the transaction, including the creator, is rewarded in MESG Tokens when others use their work. This allows for a totally free market of connection-making, efficiencies and automation.

All of this in a pay-per-transaction model, allowing users to accomplish great feats while paying very little. MESG is redefining scalability.

The MESG Infrastructure utilizes blockchain technology in two ways: 

* It allows any external blockchain technology to be connected to Core
* Within the network, the processing of a task is done off the blockchain, then the consensus-based result is submitted onto the blockchain.
