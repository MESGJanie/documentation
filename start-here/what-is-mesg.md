# What is MESG?

MESG \(pronounced ˈmesij/, or **message**\) is a technology-agnostic **infrastructure** for decentralized app development. It’s an advancement in productivity, enabling users to connect technologies with ease.

The days of unconnected dApps are over. Through only one connection to MESG's [Core](core.md), your application becomes instantly compatible with any other technology, including blockchains. 

MESG acts as a communication layer between your application and all other technologies. It organizes and dispatches information to and from all connected services and filters through a stream of real-time information to your application.

MESG saves developers hundreds of hours bridging multiple APIs to an application. The time investment required to connect to the MESG Infrastructure is roughly the same as connecting only **one** API to your application.

**In Q3 2018**, rather than writing any code whatsoever, you will be able to write a simple configuration file including desired events and tasks, then allow Core to assemble your application on your behalf.

An application on MESG can be anything from a multinational dApp store to automating a workflow for a small business, to paying personal bills or adding notifications to events on the blockchain. 

MESG allows decentralized applications to deliver the same outstanding user experience that centralized apps deliver. The possibilities and use cases are truly endless.

We are creating the best community-driven open-source infrastructure, empowering developers to use MESG to build innovations.

**In Q4 2018**, we are deploying the Network to unify the MESG infrastructure. The Network makes it easy for developers to harness the benefits of decentralization, and to share and reuse connections to technologies, making back-end app building a breeze. Once a connection from a technology to Core is made, it can be shared for free or sold in a Marketplace, allowing developers to receive income each time their connection is used. We value and incentivize contributions.
